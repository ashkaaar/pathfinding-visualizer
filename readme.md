# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

## Description
This project is a visualizer for pathfinding algorithms. It allows you to choose an algorithm, set a start and end point, and place barriers on the grid. When you run the algorithm, it will visually show you the path it takes to reach the end point.

## Features
- Supports multiple pathfinding algorithms such as A*, Dijkstra's, and Breadth-First Search.
- Interactive grid to set start and end points, and to place barriers.
- Step-by-step visualization of the pathfinding process.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pathfinding-algorithm-visualizer.git`
2. Navigate into the directory: `cd pathfinding-algorithm-visualizer`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the application: `npm start`

## Usage
1. Select a pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu.
2. Click on the grid to set the start point (green) and end point (red).
3. Click and drag on the grid to create barriers.
4. Click 'Start' to begin the visualization.
